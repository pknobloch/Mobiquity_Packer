# Mobiquity .Net Interview Assignment - Packer

I was tasked to build an class library. It is meant to take a file path and output a string. Each line of the file will contain the max package weight at the start of the line. A collection of package groups will be listed after in the format of (index, weight, cost). I need to ensure that the weight, cost, and max weight are under 100. There should never be more than 15 items per line. I then need to find the most expensive yet lightest combination and output the list of indexes per line.

The full brief can be found in Packaging Challenge.pdf.
